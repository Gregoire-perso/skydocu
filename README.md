# Skychecs

Skychecs is meant to become the new most popular desktop chess game in the
world.

No just joking, of course it won't, it's just a basic school project using Qt
and C++. But anyway, you still should try it!

# How can I play on my computer?
To do so, you just have to compile the project using `qmake` and the 
`skychecs.pro` file. It will store all compile files in the `build/` directory,
and if everything is done without errors, you can start a game by launching the
executable.
